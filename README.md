# Crystals Collector Game

**Instructions:**


1.  The player will have to guess the answer, just like in Word Guess. This time, though, the player will guess with numbers instead of letters. 

2. Rules and Instructions

    *  4 crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

    * start with a random player

        -  When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

        - The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.

    *  update the player's score counter after each click

        -  If player's total score === the random number, the player wins

        - If their score goes >== random number, the player loses

    ## The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

* When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

* The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.

        ##### Option 1 Game design additional: 
        * The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120.
        * Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
